# Restless Coder - Developer Diary

## 2025-06-01: Initial Setup and MCP Server Scaffolding

**Objective:** Create an MCP server to enable voice interaction with coding assistants. The server should be modular to support different speech recognition services and coding assistants.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Project Initialization:**
    *   Discussed the initial idea and clarified that the server should be a standalone project named `restless_coder`, located within the current Git repository (`[PROJECT_PATH]`).
    *   Used the command `npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server restless_coder` to scaffold the MCP server project. This created a new directory `restless_coder/` with the basic structure (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/index.ts`, etc.).
    *   The server description was set to "code assist with voice" during the interactive setup.

2.  **Project Setup & Build:**
    *   Navigated into the `restless_coder/` directory.
    *   Installed dependencies using `npm install`.
    *   Performed an initial build using `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript source to JavaScript in the `build/` directory. This step also ensures the basic scaffolded server compiles correctly.

3.  **Core Tool Definition (`src/index.ts`):**
    *   Modified the template `src/index.ts` to define the primary tool for this server.
    *   Removed the example "notes" system (resources, tools, prompts).
    *   Defined a new tool:
        *   **Name:** `process_voice_command`
        *   **Description:** "Processes a voice command by transcribing audio, interacting with a coding assistant, and optionally returning audio."
        *   **Input Schema:**
            *   `audio_input_type`: (string, enum: `"file_path"`, `"base64_encoded"`)
            *   `audio_data`: (string)
            *   `speech_service_id`: (string)
            *   `coding_assistant_id`: (string)
            *   `output_format`: (string, enum: `"text"`, `"audio"`, default: `"text"`)
        *   Required fields: `audio_input_type`, `audio_data`, `speech_service_id`, `coding_assistant_id`.
    *   The implementation within `CallToolRequestSchema` for `process_voice_command` currently contains placeholders for:
        *   Speech-to-text transcription.
        *   Interaction with the coding assistant.
        *   Text-to-speech synthesis (if `output_format` is `audio`).
        *   Voice approval mechanisms.
    *   Added basic argument validation and error handling.

4.  **MCP Server Installation (Configuration):**
    *   Updated the Cline MCP settings file (`[USER_SETTINGS_PATH]/cline_mcp_settings.json`).
    *   Added a new entry for the `restless_coder` server:
        ```json
        "restless_coder": {
          "command": "node",
          "args": ["[PROJECT_PATH]/restless_coder/build/index.js"],
          "env": {},
          "disabled": false,
          "autoApprove": []
        }
        ```
    *   This makes the server and its `process_voice_command` tool available to the MCP client (e.g., Cline).

**Current Status:**
*   The basic MCP server structure is in place.
*   The `process_voice_command` tool is defined with its input schema.
*   The server is configured to run via the MCP settings.
*   The core logic for actual voice processing and assistant interaction is placeholder and needs implementation.

**Next Steps (Conceptual):**
*   Implement concrete `SpeechRecognitionService` modules (e.g., for Web Speech API, local Whisper).
*   Implement concrete `CodingAssistantService` modules (e.g., for Cline, GitHub Copilot).
*   Implement a `TextToSpeechService` module.
*   Develop a mechanism for managing and selecting these services based on `speech_service_id` and `coding_assistant_id`.
*   Design and implement the voice approval flow.
*   Add comprehensive error handling and logging.
*   Write unit and integration tests.

## 2025-06-01 (Part 2): Webview Host Extension for Voice Client

**Objective:** Create a VS Code extension to host the `index.html` voice client in a Webview, enabling it to communicate with the VS Code environment and eventually the Cline assistant.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Scaffolded `voice-client-host` Extension:**
    *   Used `yo code` to create a new TypeScript-based VS Code extension named `voice-client-host` within the `restless_coder` project directory (`restless_coder/voice-client-host/`).
    *   Chose "unbundled" and "npm" during scaffolding.

2.  **Integrated `index.html`:**
    *   Copied the existing `index.html` (voice client UI) to `voice-client-host/media/index.html`.

3.  **Developed Webview Logic (`voice-client-host/src/extension.ts`):**
    *   Registered a new command `voice-client-host.showVoiceClient`.
    *   Implemented logic to create a `WebviewPanel` when this command is run.
    *   The panel loads `media/index.html`, applying appropriate CSP and resource URI handling.
    *   Set up message listeners (`onDidReceiveMessage`) for communication between the webview and the extension.
    *   Currently, if the webview sends a `sendToCline` message, the extension logs it and sends a *simulated* Cline response back to the webview.

4.  **Adapted `index.html` for Webview (`voice-client-host/media/index.html`):**
    *   Modified the script to use `acquireVsCodeApi()`.
    *   The `sendToServer` function now uses `vscode.postMessage({ command: 'sendToCline', text: transcribedText })` to send data to the extension.
    *   Added `window.addEventListener('message', ...)` to listen for `clineResponse` messages from the extension and then display/speak them.

5.  **Configured `package.json` (`voice-client-host/package.json`):**
    *   Updated `contributes.commands` to declare `voice-client-host.showVoiceClient` with the title "Show Voice Client".
    *   Added `onCommand:voice-client-host.showVoiceClient` to `activationEvents`.

6.  **Compiled Extension:**
    *   Ran `npm run compile` within the `voice-client-host` directory to build the extension.

**Current Status:**
*   The `voice-client-host` extension is scaffolded, configured, and compiled.
*   It can display the `index.html` voice client in a webview.
*   Basic two-way message passing between the webview and the extension backend is implemented.
*   Interaction with the actual Cline assistant from the extension backend is currently a placeholder (simulated response).

**Next Steps (Testing `voice-client-host`):**

1.  **Open `voice-client-host` in VS Code:** Ensure the `[PROJECT_PATH]/voice-client-host/` project is open in a VS Code window.
2.  **Launch Extension Development Host:** Press `F5` (or use Run and Debug > "Run Extension"). This opens a new VS Code window with the `voice-client-host` extension active.
3.  **Run Command:** In the new "[Extension Development Host]" window, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run "Show Voice Client".
4.  **Test Webview:**
    *   The "Voice Client" panel should appear with the `index.html` interface.
    *   Grant microphone permission if prompted.
    *   Use voice input. The transcribed text should appear.
    *   A simulated response (e.g., `Cline (simulated) processed: "your text"`) should be displayed and spoken by the webview.
5.  **Check Logs:**
    *   **Webview Console:** In the "Voice Client" panel, right-click and "Open Webview Developer Tools" to see logs from `index.html`.
    *   **Extension Console:** In the original VS Code window (where F5 was pressed), open Help > Toggle Developer Tools to see `[Extension] ...` logs from `extension.ts`.

**Future Development (Post-Testing):**
*   Implement actual MCP communication in `extension.ts` to forward `sendToCline` messages to the real Cline assistant and relay its responses.

## 2025-06-01 (Part 3): Refactor Voice Interaction Model & UI Integration

**Objective:** Refactor the voice interaction model to have Cline directly use the `process_voice_command` tool, guided by a custom instruction set. Integrate the voice client UI into the `restless_coder` server to remove dependency on the `voice-client-host` extension for this workflow.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Protocol Definition:**
    *   Created `restless_coder/.clinerules/voice_interaction_protocol.md`. This document defines the new interaction model where Cline acts as the primary agent, using the `process_voice_command` tool to interpret voice commands (provided as transcribed text).

2.  **UI Relocation and Adaptation:**
    *   The voice client UI (`index.html`) was moved from `voice-client-host/media/index.html` to a new location: `restless_coder/ui/index.html`.
    *   The new `restless_coder/ui/index.html` was modified to remove VS Code-specific API calls (`acquireVsCodeApi`, `vscode.postMessage`) and the script `nonce`. It's now a standalone HTML page that displays transcribed text for manual copying by the user.

3.  **`restless_coder` Server Enhancements (`src/index.ts`):**
    *   **HTTP Server:** Added functionality to `restless_coder/src/index.ts` for an HTTP server to serve the `restless_coder/ui/index.html` page.
    *   **Port Configuration:** The HTTP server port was set to `6543` (initially `3000`, changed due to `EADDRINUSE` and user request).
    *   **ES Module Compatibility:** Resolved a `ReferenceError: __dirname is not defined` by using `import.meta.url` and `fileURLToPath` to correctly determine file paths in an ES module context.
    *   **Startup Robustness:** Improved the server startup sequence in `main()` to handle errors from both HTTP and MCP server initialization more explicitly and provide clearer logging. Implemented more robust graceful shutdown logic for both servers.

4.  **Troubleshooting Server Startup:**
    *   Addressed shell command separator issues for `execute_command` tool usage (using `;` for PowerShell compatibility instead of `&&`).
    *   Diagnosed an `EADDRINUSE` error on port `6543` by using `netstat -ano | Select-String -Pattern ":6543"` to identify the conflicting Process ID.
    *   Successfully terminated the conflicting process (PID `31008`) using `taskkill /PID 31008 /F`.

**Current Status:**
*   The `restless_coder` MCP server now starts successfully.
*   It serves its own voice client UI from `restless_coder/ui/index.html` at `http://localhost:6543`.
*   The server is ready for testing the new voice protocol where Cline processes transcribed text (obtained from the UI and manually copied by the user).
*   The dependency on the `voice-client-host` VS Code extension for the primary voice input and transcription step (for this new protocol) has been effectively removed. The user can now open the UI in a standard browser.

**Next Steps (User):**
*   Test the new workflow:
    1.  Ensure the `restless_coder` server is running (Cline/MCP client should manage this).
    2.  Open `http://localhost:6543` in a web browser.
    3.  Use the UI to transcribe a voice command.
    4.  Copy the transcribed text.
    5.  Instruct Cline (in chat) to activate the protocol defined in `restless_coder/.clinerules/voice_interaction_protocol.md`.
    6.  Provide the copied text to Cline for processing.
*   Consider further development for `process_voice_command` if server-side transcription (beyond "webspeech" pass-through) or more direct integration is desired.
*   Optionally, decide on the future of the `voice-client-host` extension (e.g., deprecate, refactor for other purposes, or remove).

## 2025-06-01 (Part 4): Implement & Test "Listen" Mode for Voice Protocol

**Objective:** Implement a "listen" mode for the `process_voice_command` tool in the `restless_coder` server. This mode allows Cline to invoke the tool to wait for voice input (transcribed by `ui/index.html` and sent via HTTP) rather than processing immediately provided audio/text. Also, refine the voice interaction protocol documentation and test the end-to-end flow.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Conceptualized "Listen" Mode:**
    *   User requested that Cline, upon activation of the voice protocol, should call `process_voice_command` to enter a waiting state, expecting the tool to return transcribed text when available.

2.  **`restless_coder/src/index.ts` Modifications:**
    *   **Schema Update:** The `inputSchema` for `process_voice_command` was adjusted so `audio_data`, `audio_input_type`, and `speech_service_id` are optional if `coding_assistant_id` is `"cline"`, enabling a "listen" mode invocation.
    *   **Listen Logic:** Implemented promise-based waiting within the `CallToolRequestSchema` handler. If called with `coding_assistant_id: "cline"` and no `audio_data`, the tool waits for an internal promise to be resolved. A 60-second timeout was added to this listen state.
    *   **HTTP Endpoint:** Added a new `POST` endpoint `/submit-transcribed-text`. This endpoint expects JSON `{ "text": "transcribed_command" }` and resolves the aforementioned promise, thus providing the text to the waiting tool instance.
    *   **Error Handling:** Corrected `ErrorCode.Unavailable` to `ErrorCode.InvalidRequest` for concurrent listen attempts.
    *   **Logging:** Added more detailed `console.log` statements throughout the listen mode logic and HTTP endpoint handler for debugging.

3.  **`restless_coder/ui/index.html` Modifications:**
    *   The `handleTranscription` JavaScript function was made `async`.
    *   It now uses `fetch` to `POST` the transcribed text as JSON to `http://localhost:6543/submit-transcribed-text`.
    *   The UI prompt (`<p id="copyPrompt">`) was updated to reflect that text is sent automatically.
    *   Added UI messages to indicate success/failure of text submission to the server.

4.  **Port Conflict Management Script:**
    *   Created `restless_coder/kill_port_6543.ps1`, a PowerShell script to find and terminate any process using port 6543, to help ensure the server can start without `EADDRINUSE` errors.

5.  **Troubleshooting & Testing:**
    *   Addressed shell command syntax for `npm run build` (using `;` instead of `&&` for PowerShell).
    *   Iteratively debugged server startup issues (port conflicts, ensuring MCP client reconnects).
    *   Successfully tested the end-to-end "listen" mode: Cline called `process_voice_command`, the tool waited, user spoke into `ui/index.html`, UI sent text to server, server tool relayed text to Cline. Test phrase "hi this is a test of the tool" was correctly received.
    *   Identified a persistent issue where `write_to_file` failed silently to create `testing testing 1 2 3.txt`. This remains unresolved.
    *   Discussed `autoApprove` settings for `process_voice_command` in `cline_mcp_settings.json` to avoid repeated approval prompts for Cline's use of the tool.

6.  **Protocol Refinement & Documentation:**
    *   Based on successful testing of "listen" mode, the user defined a continuous operational loop: Cline executes a command, then immediately re-enters listen mode.
    *   A strategy for handling commands requiring approval was outlined: Cline states the need for approval, then re-listens for a voice confirmation.
    *   Updated `restless_coder/.clinerules/voice_interaction_protocol.md` extensively to document the new "listen" mode functionality, the continuous loop, and the approval handling strategy.

**Current Status:**
*   The "listen" mode for `process_voice_command` is implemented and functional.
*   The `ui/index.html` client correctly submits transcribed text to the server for this mode.
*   The voice interaction protocol documentation (`.clinerules/voice_interaction_protocol.md`) is updated to reflect the current system and operational guidelines.
*   A utility script (`kill_port_6543.ps1`) is available for managing port conflicts.
*   The system is ready for use under the refined voice protocol.

**Next Steps (User & Cline):**
*   Further testing of the voice protocol with more complex commands.
*   Investigate and resolve the `write_to_file` issue for filenames with spaces.
*   User to verify and ensure `autoApprove` settings for `process_voice_command` in `cline_mcp_settings.json` are correctly configured and propagating to avoid repeated approval prompts.
*   Consider long-term enhancements (server-side transcription, TTS, advanced approval UI) as originally planned.
*   Decide on the future of the `voice-client-host/` VS Code extension.

## 2025-06-01 (Part 5): Implement TTS Responses in Voice Protocol

**Objective:** Enhance the voice interaction protocol by enabling Cline to send spoken responses back to the user via the `restless_coder/ui/index.html` interface, using browser-based Text-to-Speech (TTS).

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **`write_to_file` Investigation (Brief):**
    *   Confirmed `write_to_file` tool was working for filenames with and without spaces (e.g., `test_file.txt`, `testing testing 1 2 3.txt`). Concluded prior issues were transient. Test files were deleted.

2.  **UI Enhancements for TTS (`restless_coder/ui/index.html`):**
    *   **HTML Structure:** Added a `div` with a `label` and `<select id="voiceSelect">` dropdown for voice selection.
    *   **JavaScript - TTS Logic:**
        *   Implemented `populateVoiceList()` to get available system voices using `speechSynthesis.getVoices()` and populate the dropdown. This function is also attached to `speechSynthesis.onvoiceschanged`.
        *   Implemented `speak(textToSpeak)` function that creates a `SpeechSynthesisUtterance`, sets the selected voice (from `selectedVoiceURI` chosen via the dropdown), and calls `speechSynthesis.speak()`.
        *   Added checks for browser support for `SpeechSynthesis`.
    *   **JavaScript - SSE Client:**
        *   Implemented a Server-Sent Events (SSE) client connecting to a new `/voice-events` endpoint on the local server.
        *   The `onmessage` handler for SSE expects JSON data like `{ "displayText": "...", "speechText": "..." }`. It calls `addMessage()` to show `displayText` and `speak()` to voice `speechText`.
        *   Basic error handling for SSE connection was included.

3.  **Server Enhancements for TTS (`restless_coder/src/index.ts`):**
    *   **SSE Client Management:** Added a global array `sseClients` to store active `http.ServerResponse` objects for connected SSE clients.
    *   **SSE Endpoint:** Implemented the `/voice-events` HTTP endpoint. When a client connects:
        *   Appropriate SSE headers (`Content-Type: text/event-stream`, etc.) are set.
        *   An initial connection confirmation event is sent to the client.
        *   The client's `response` object is added to `sseClients`.
        *   A `req.on('close')` handler removes the client from `sseClients` upon disconnection.
    *   **`process_voice_command` Tool Modification:**
        *   **Input Schema:** Added two new optional string parameters: `response_display_text` and `response_speech_text`.
        *   **Tool Logic:**
            *   A new operational mode was added: If `response_speech_text` is provided in the arguments, the tool constructs a JSON payload containing `displayText` (defaults to `response_speech_text` if `response_display_text` is missing) and `speechText`.
            *   This payload is then sent as an SSE message (`data: ${payload}\n\n`) to all currently connected clients in the `sseClients` array.
            *   The tool then returns a simple success message (e.g., "Response sent to UI via SSE.") to Cline.
            *   The existing "listen" and "process audio" modes of the tool remain functional and are prioritized after the new "send response" mode check.

4.  **Voice Interaction Protocol Update (`restless_coder/.clinerules/voice_interaction_protocol.md`):**
    *   Updated Cline's responsibilities to include formulating both a concise speech response (max 2-3 sentences) and a potentially more verbose display text.
    *   Modified the interaction flow: after Cline executes a command, it now calls `process_voice_command` (with `response_display_text` and `response_speech_text`) to send its response to the UI, *before* re-entering listen mode.
    *   Updated the custom instruction set for Cline to reflect these new response formulation and delivery steps.
    *   Updated prerequisites to include the new server/UI capabilities (SSE, TTS, new tool parameters).

5.  **Testing the Enhanced Protocol:**
    *   After the user rebuilt and restarted the `restless_coder` server, the updated voice protocol was initiated.
    *   Successfully tested:
        *   Basic "can you hear me" interaction with spoken response from Cline.
        *   A simple calculation ("whats 2 + 3") with spoken result.
        *   Reciting text ("Homer's Odyssey") with spoken recitation.
        *   A multi-turn command (file creation, asking for filename) where Cline's questions and confirmations were spoken.
    *   The session concluded with the user verbally ending the protocol.

**Current Status:**
*   The voice interaction system now supports TTS responses from Cline, delivered to the UI via SSE.
*   The UI allows voice selection for TTS.
*   The `process_voice_command` tool and the voice interaction protocol documentation have been updated to reflect these new capabilities.
*   The system has been successfully tested with these enhancements.

## 2025-06-01 (Part 6): Code Cleanup, Refactoring, and UI Bug Fixes

**Objective:** Improve code maintainability, organization, and resolve UI functionality issues that arose after initial refactoring.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Server-Side Refactoring (`restless_coder/src/index.ts`):**
    *   Removed unused/placeholder interface definitions (`SpeechRecognitionService`, etc.).
    *   Modularized HTTP route handling: Logic for `/`, `/submit-transcribed-text`, and `/voice-events` was moved from `index.ts` into a new dedicated file: `restless_coder/src/httpHandlers.ts`.
    *   The main `CallToolRequestSchema` handler in `index.ts` was refactored to delegate its core logic (Send Response, Process Audio, Listen modes) to smaller, internal helper functions (`handleSendCommandResponseMode`, `handleProcessAudioMode`, `handleListenMode`, `processTranscribedTextAndRespond`) for improved clarity and structure.
    *   Standardized logging prefixes across `index.ts` and `httpHandlers.ts` (e.g., `[HTTP Handler]`, `[Tool Process]`, `[Lifecycle]`, `[Startup]`) for better log readability.
    *   Reviewed and confirmed the existing `gracefulShutdown` logic.

2.  **Client-Side UI Refactoring (`restless_coder/ui/`):**
    *   The monolithic JavaScript block in `restless_coder/ui/index.html` was broken down into separate ES modules:
        *   `uiUtils.js`: Contains shared DOM element accessors (e.g., `voiceButton`, `messagesDiv`) and utility functions like `addMessage`. DOM elements are now initialized via `initializeUiElements()` called on `DOMContentLoaded`.
        *   `speechRecognition.js`: Encapsulates all Web Speech API (STT) related setup, event handlers, and transcription submission logic.
        *   `textToSpeech.js`: Encapsulates all Web Speech Synthesis API (TTS) related setup, voice population, and speaking logic.
        *   `sseClient.js`: Handles the Server-Sent Events client connection and message processing for receiving responses from the server.
    *   `restless_coder/ui/index.html` was updated to use `<script type="module">` to import and initialize these new JavaScript modules.

3.  **Bug Fixing - UI Functionality:**
    *   **Initial Issue:** UI buttons and dropdowns were non-functional after initial JS modularization.
    *   **Diagnosis 1:** Hypothesized that DOM elements were being accessed by modules before the DOM was fully loaded.
    *   **Fix 1 Attempted:** Modified `uiUtils.js` to populate its exported DOM element variables within an `initializeUiElements()` function, and updated `index.html` to call this function first on `DOMContentLoaded`. This aimed to ensure elements were available when other modules' `initialize...` functions ran.
    *   **Diagnosis 2 (Server Connection Failure):** After Fix 1, the server failed to start, preventing UI testing.
    *   **Fix 2 (Server Startup):** Identified a `ReferenceError` in `httpHandlers.ts` caused by accessing `UI_FILE_PATH` (imported from `index.ts`) before it was initialized (Temporal Dead Zone). Resolved this by making `UI_BASE_DIR` in `httpHandlers.ts` lazy-initialized via a `getUiBaseDir()` function.
    *   **Diagnosis 3 (UI Still Not Working - Module Loading):** After Fix 2, the UI was still non-functional. Realized the HTTP server in `index.ts` was not configured to serve `.js` files from the `ui/` directory with the correct MIME type (`application/javascript`), leading to module loading failures.
    *   **Fix 3 (Static File Serving):**
        *   Added a `handleStaticFile` function to `httpHandlers.ts` to serve files from the `ui/` directory, setting `Content-Type: application/javascript` for `.js` files.
        *   Updated the HTTP server routing logic in `index.ts` to use `handleStaticFile` for requests ending in `.js` (and `.css`).

4.  **Testing and Verification:**
    *   After implementing Fix 3 and rebuilding, the server started successfully.
    *   The UI (`http://localhost:6543`) became functional: the "Start Listening" button and voice selection dropdown worked as expected.
    *   Successfully tested the end-to-end voice interaction protocol:
        *   Cline initiated "listen" mode.
        *   User spoke "do you hear me" into the UI.
        *   Transcribed text was sent to the server and then to Cline.
        *   Cline responded "Yes, I hear you loud and clear!", which was displayed and spoken in the UI.
        *   Cline re-entered listen mode.
        *   User spoke "fantastic thanks so much".
        *   Cline responded "You're welcome!", which was displayed and spoken in the UI.
        *   Cline re-entered listen mode.

5.  **Other Files:**
    *   `restless_coder/voice-client-host/`: Confirmed to be empty/non-existent, requiring no action.
    *   `restless_coder/kill_port_6543.ps1`: Reviewed and retained as a useful utility.
    *   `README.md`: Reviewed and determined no updates were necessary for these internal refactoring changes.

**Current Status:**
*   The codebase has been significantly refactored for better organization and maintainability.
*   Critical UI bugs related to JavaScript module loading and DOM initialization have been resolved.
*   The voice interaction protocol is confirmed to be working correctly after the changes.
*   The project is in a stable state, ready for further feature development (e.g., responsiveness improvements, Codespaces support).

## 2025-06-01 (Part 7): TypeScript Error Resolution and Voice Protocol Test

**Objective:** Resolve persistent TypeScript errors in `src/index.ts` and conduct a test of the voice interaction protocol.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **TypeScript Error Investigation (`src/index.ts`):**
    *   Iteratively diagnosed a "Declaration or statement expected" error.
    *   Initial attempts involved changing `catch (error: any)` to `catch (error: unknown)` and refactoring the `handleListenMode` function's promise logic.
    *   The error was ultimately resolved by reordering the helper function definitions (`handleSendCommandResponseMode`, `handleProcessAudioMode`, `handleListenMode`, `processTranscribedTextAndRespond`) to appear *before* the main `server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, ...)` block. This suggests a parsing or hoisting-related issue with the previous structure.

2.  **Project Build:**
    *   Successfully compiled the project using `npm run build`, confirming no TypeScript errors remained.

3.  **Voice Interaction Protocol Test:**
    *   Initiated the voice protocol.
    *   Cline entered "listen" mode using the `process_voice_command` tool.
    *   User spoke "can you hear me". The tool returned this text to Cline.
    *   Cline responded "Yes, I hear you loud and clear!". This response was sent to the UI using `process_voice_command` in "send response" mode.
    *   Cline re-entered "listen" mode.
    *   User spoke "end the protocol". The tool returned this text to Cline.
    *   Cline responded "Okay, I am ending the voice interaction protocol.". This response was sent to the UI.
