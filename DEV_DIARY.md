# Restless Coder - Developer Diary

## 2025-06-01: Initial Setup and MCP Server Scaffolding

**Objective:** Create an MCP server to enable voice interaction with coding assistants. The server should be modular to support different speech recognition services and coding assistants.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Project Initialization:**
    *   Discussed the initial idea and clarified that the server should be a standalone project named `restless_coder`, located within the current Git repository (`[PROJECT_PATH]`).
    *   Used the command `npx @modelcontextprotocol/create-server restless_coder` to scaffold the MCP server project. This created a new directory `restless_coder/` with the basic structure (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/index.ts`, etc.).
    *   The server description was set to "code assist with voice" during the interactive setup.

2.  **Project Setup & Build:**
    *   Navigated into the `restless_coder/` directory.
    *   Installed dependencies using `npm install`.
    *   Performed an initial build using `npm run build` to compile the TypeScript source to JavaScript in the `build/` directory. This step also ensures the basic scaffolded server compiles correctly.

3.  **Core Tool Definition (`src/index.ts`):**
    *   Modified the template `src/index.ts` to define the primary tool for this server.
    *   Removed the example "notes" system (resources, tools, prompts).
    *   Defined a new tool:
        *   **Name:** `process_voice_command`
        *   **Description:** "Processes a voice command by transcribing audio, interacting with a coding assistant, and optionally returning audio."
        *   **Input Schema:**
            *   `audio_input_type`: (string, enum: `"file_path"`, `"base64_encoded"`)
            *   `audio_data`: (string)
            *   `speech_service_id`: (string)
            *   `coding_assistant_id`: (string)
            *   `output_format`: (string, enum: `"text"`, `"audio"`, default: `"text"`)
        *   Required fields: `audio_input_type`, `audio_data`, `speech_service_id`, `coding_assistant_id`.
    *   The implementation within `CallToolRequestSchema` for `process_voice_command` currently contains placeholders for:
        *   Speech-to-text transcription.
        *   Interaction with the coding assistant.
        *   Text-to-speech synthesis (if `output_format` is `audio`).
        *   Voice approval mechanisms.
    *   Added basic argument validation and error handling.

4.  **MCP Server Installation (Configuration):**
    *   Updated the Cline MCP settings file (`[USER_SETTINGS_PATH]/cline_mcp_settings.json`).
    *   Added a new entry for the `restless_coder` server:
        ```json
        "restless_coder": {
          "command": "node",
          "args": ["[PROJECT_PATH]/restless_coder/build/index.js"],
          "env": {},
          "disabled": false,
          "autoApprove": []
        }
        ```
    *   This makes the server and its `process_voice_command` tool available to the MCP client (e.g., Cline).

**Current Status:**
*   The basic MCP server structure is in place.
*   The `process_voice_command` tool is defined with its input schema.
*   The server is configured to run via the MCP settings.
*   The core logic for actual voice processing and assistant interaction is placeholder and needs implementation.

**Next Steps (Conceptual):**
*   Implement concrete `SpeechRecognitionService` modules (e.g., for Web Speech API, local Whisper).
*   Implement concrete `CodingAssistantService` modules (e.g., for Cline, GitHub Copilot).
*   Implement a `TextToSpeechService` module.
*   Develop a mechanism for managing and selecting these services based on `speech_service_id` and `coding_assistant_id`.
*   Design and implement the voice approval flow.
*   Add comprehensive error handling and logging.
*   Write unit and integration tests.

## 2025-06-01 (Part 2): Webview Host Extension for Voice Client

**Objective:** Create a VS Code extension to host the `index.html` voice client in a Webview, enabling it to communicate with the VS Code environment and eventually the Cline assistant.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Scaffolded `voice-client-host` Extension:**
    *   Used `yo code` to create a new TypeScript-based VS Code extension named `voice-client-host` within the `restless_coder` project directory (`restless_coder/voice-client-host/`).
    *   Chose "unbundled" and "npm" during scaffolding.

2.  **Integrated `index.html`:**
    *   Copied the existing `index.html` (voice client UI) to `voice-client-host/media/index.html`.

3.  **Developed Webview Logic (`voice-client-host/src/extension.ts`):**
    *   Registered a new command `voice-client-host.showVoiceClient`.
    *   Implemented logic to create a `WebviewPanel` when this command is run.
    *   The panel loads `media/index.html`, applying appropriate CSP and resource URI handling.
    *   Set up message listeners (`onDidReceiveMessage`) for communication between the webview and the extension.
    *   Currently, if the webview sends a `sendToCline` message, the extension logs it and sends a *simulated* Cline response back to the webview.

4.  **Adapted `index.html` for Webview (`voice-client-host/media/index.html`):**
    *   Modified the script to use `acquireVsCodeApi()`.
    *   The `sendToServer` function now uses `vscode.postMessage({ command: 'sendToCline', text: transcribedText })` to send data to the extension.
    *   Added `window.addEventListener('message', ...)` to listen for `clineResponse` messages from the extension and then display/speak them.

5.  **Configured `package.json` (`voice-client-host/package.json`):**
    *   Updated `contributes.commands` to declare `voice-client-host.showVoiceClient` with the title "Show Voice Client".
    *   Added `onCommand:voice-client-host.showVoiceClient` to `activationEvents`.

6.  **Compiled Extension:**
    *   Ran `npm run compile` within the `voice-client-host` directory to build the extension.

**Current Status:**
*   The `voice-client-host` extension is scaffolded, configured, and compiled.
*   It can display the `index.html` voice client in a webview.
*   Basic two-way message passing between the webview and the extension backend is implemented.
*   Interaction with the actual Cline assistant from the extension backend is currently a placeholder (simulated response).

**Next Steps (Testing `voice-client-host`):**

1.  **Open `voice-client-host` in VS Code:** Ensure the `[PROJECT_PATH]/voice-client-host/` project is open in a VS Code window.
2.  **Launch Extension Development Host:** Press `F5` (or use Run and Debug > "Run Extension"). This opens a new VS Code window with the `voice-client-host` extension active.
3.  **Run Command:** In the new "[Extension Development Host]" window, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and run "Show Voice Client".
4.  **Test Webview:**
    *   The "Voice Client" panel should appear with the `index.html` interface.
    *   Grant microphone permission if prompted.
    *   Use voice input. The transcribed text should appear.
    *   A simulated response (e.g., `Cline (simulated) processed: "your text"`) should be displayed and spoken by the webview.
5.  **Check Logs:**
    *   **Webview Console:** In the "Voice Client" panel, right-click and "Open Webview Developer Tools" to see logs from `index.html`.
    *   **Extension Console:** In the original VS Code window (where F5 was pressed), open Help > Toggle Developer Tools to see `[Extension] ...` logs from `extension.ts`.

**Future Development (Post-Testing):**
*   Implement actual MCP communication in `extension.ts` to forward `sendToCline` messages to the real Cline assistant and relay its responses.

## 2025-06-01 (Part 3): Refactor Voice Interaction Model & UI Integration

**Objective:** Refactor the voice interaction model to have Cline directly use the `process_voice_command` tool, guided by a custom instruction set. Integrate the voice client UI into the `restless_coder` server to remove dependency on the `voice-client-host` extension for this workflow.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Protocol Definition:**
    *   Created `restless_coder/.clinerules/voice_interaction_protocol.md`. This document defines the new interaction model where Cline acts as the primary agent, using the `process_voice_command` tool to interpret voice commands (provided as transcribed text).

2.  **UI Relocation and Adaptation:**
    *   The voice client UI (`index.html`) was moved from `voice-client-host/media/index.html` to a new location: `restless_coder/ui/index.html`.
    *   The new `restless_coder/ui/index.html` was modified to remove VS Code-specific API calls (`acquireVsCodeApi`, `vscode.postMessage`) and the script `nonce`. It's now a standalone HTML page that displays transcribed text for manual copying by the user.

3.  **`restless_coder` Server Enhancements (`src/index.ts`):**
    *   **HTTP Server:** Added functionality to `restless_coder/src/index.ts` for an HTTP server to serve the `restless_coder/ui/index.html` page.
    *   **Port Configuration:** The HTTP server port was set to `6543` (initially `3000`, changed due to `EADDRINUSE` and user request).
    *   **ES Module Compatibility:** Resolved a `ReferenceError: __dirname is not defined` by using `import.meta.url` and `fileURLToPath` to correctly determine file paths in an ES module context.
    *   **Startup Robustness:** Improved the server startup sequence in `main()` to handle errors from both HTTP and MCP server initialization more explicitly and provide clearer logging. Implemented more robust graceful shutdown logic for both servers.

4.  **Troubleshooting Server Startup:**
    *   Addressed shell command separator issues for `execute_command` tool usage (using `;` for PowerShell compatibility instead of `&&`).
    *   Diagnosed an `EADDRINUSE` error on port `6543` by using `netstat -ano | Select-String -Pattern ":6543"` to identify the conflicting Process ID.
    *   Successfully terminated the conflicting process (PID `31008`) using `taskkill /PID 31008 /F`.

**Current Status:**
*   The `restless_coder` MCP server now starts successfully.
*   It serves its own voice client UI from `restless_coder/ui/index.html` at `http://localhost:6543`.
*   The server is ready for testing the new voice protocol where Cline processes transcribed text (obtained from the UI and manually copied by the user).
*   The dependency on the `voice-client-host` VS Code extension for the primary voice input and transcription step (for this new protocol) has been effectively removed. The user can now open the UI in a standard browser.

**Next Steps (User):**
*   Test the new workflow:
    1.  Ensure the `restless_coder` server is running (Cline/MCP client should manage this).
    2.  Open `http://localhost:6543` in a web browser.
    3.  Use the UI to transcribe a voice command.
    4.  Copy the transcribed text.
    5.  Instruct Cline (in chat) to activate the protocol defined in `restless_coder/.clinerules/voice_interaction_protocol.md`.
    6.  Provide the copied text to Cline for processing.
*   Consider further development for `process_voice_command` if server-side transcription (beyond "webspeech" pass-through) or more direct integration is desired.
*   Optionally, decide on the future of the `voice-client-host` extension (e.g., deprecate, refactor for other purposes, or remove).

## 2025-06-01 (Part 4): Implement & Test "Listen" Mode for Voice Protocol

**Objective:** Implement a "listen" mode for the `process_voice_command` tool in the `restless_coder` server. This mode allows Cline to invoke the tool to wait for voice input (transcribed by `ui/index.html` and sent via HTTP) rather than processing immediately provided audio/text. Also, refine the voice interaction protocol documentation and test the end-to-end flow.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Conceptualized "Listen" Mode:**
    *   User requested that Cline, upon activation of the voice protocol, should call `process_voice_command` to enter a waiting state, expecting the tool to return transcribed text when available.

2.  **`restless_coder/src/index.ts` Modifications:**
    *   **Schema Update:** The `inputSchema` for `process_voice_command` was adjusted so `audio_data`, `audio_input_type`, and `speech_service_id` are optional if `coding_assistant_id` is `"cline"`, enabling a "listen" mode invocation.
    *   **Listen Logic:** Implemented promise-based waiting within the `CallToolRequestSchema` handler. If called with `coding_assistant_id: "cline"` and no `audio_data`, the tool waits for an internal promise to be resolved. A 60-second timeout was added to this listen state.
    *   **HTTP Endpoint:** Added a new `POST` endpoint `/submit-transcribed-text`. This endpoint expects JSON `{ "text": "transcribed_command" }` and resolves the aforementioned promise, thus providing the text to the waiting tool instance.
    *   **Error Handling:** Corrected `ErrorCode.Unavailable` to `ErrorCode.InvalidRequest` for concurrent listen attempts.
    *   **Logging:** Added more detailed `console.log` statements throughout the listen mode logic and HTTP endpoint handler for debugging.

3.  **`restless_coder/ui/index.html` Modifications:**
    *   The `handleTranscription` JavaScript function was made `async`.
    *   It now uses `fetch` to `POST` the transcribed text as JSON to `http://localhost:6543/submit-transcribed-text`.
    *   The UI prompt (`<p id="copyPrompt">`) was updated to reflect that text is sent automatically.
    *   Added UI messages to indicate success/failure of text submission to the server.

4.  **Port Conflict Management Script:**
    *   Created `restless_coder/kill_port_6543.ps1`, a PowerShell script to find and terminate any process using port 6543, to help ensure the server can start without `EADDRINUSE` errors.

5.  **Troubleshooting & Testing:**
    *   Addressed shell command syntax for `npm run build` (using `;` instead of `&&` for PowerShell).
    *   Iteratively debugged server startup issues (port conflicts, ensuring MCP client reconnects).
    *   Successfully tested the end-to-end "listen" mode: Cline called `process_voice_command`, the tool waited, user spoke into `ui/index.html`, UI sent text to server, server tool relayed text to Cline. Test phrase "hi this is a test of the tool" was correctly received.
    *   Identified a persistent issue where `write_to_file` failed silently to create `testing testing 1 2 3.txt`. This remains unresolved.
    *   Discussed `autoApprove` settings for `process_voice_command` in `cline_mcp_settings.json` to avoid repeated approval prompts for Cline's use of the tool.

6.  **Protocol Refinement & Documentation:**
    *   Based on successful testing of "listen" mode, the user defined a continuous operational loop: Cline executes a command, then immediately re-enters listen mode.
    *   A strategy for handling commands requiring approval was outlined: Cline states the need for approval, then re-listens for a voice confirmation.
    *   Updated `restless_coder/.clinerules/voice_interaction_protocol.md` extensively to document the new "listen" mode functionality, the continuous loop, and the approval handling strategy.

**Current Status:**
*   The "listen" mode for `process_voice_command` is implemented and functional.
*   The `ui/index.html` client correctly submits transcribed text to the server for this mode.
*   The voice interaction protocol documentation (`.clinerules/voice_interaction_protocol.md`) is updated to reflect the current system and operational guidelines.
*   A utility script (`kill_port_6543.ps1`) is available for managing port conflicts.
*   The system is ready for use under the refined voice protocol.

**Next Steps (User & Cline):**
*   Further testing of the voice protocol with more complex commands.
*   Investigate and resolve the `write_to_file` issue for filenames with spaces.
*   User to verify and ensure `autoApprove` settings for `process_voice_command` in `cline_mcp_settings.json` are correctly configured and propagating to avoid repeated approval prompts.
*   Consider long-term enhancements (server-side transcription, TTS, advanced approval UI) as originally planned.
*   Decide on the future of the `voice-client-host/` VS Code extension.

## 2025-06-01 (Part 5): Implement TTS Responses in Voice Protocol

**Objective:** Enhance the voice interaction protocol by enabling Cline to send spoken responses back to the user via the `restless_coder/ui/index.html` interface, using browser-based Text-to-Speech (TTS).

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **`write_to_file` Investigation (Brief):**
    *   Confirmed `write_to_file` tool was working for filenames with and without spaces (e.g., `test_file.txt`, `testing testing 1 2 3.txt`). Concluded prior issues were transient. Test files were deleted.

2.  **UI Enhancements for TTS (`restless_coder/ui/index.html`):**
    *   **HTML Structure:** Added a `div` with a `label` and `<select id="voiceSelect">` dropdown for voice selection.
    *   **JavaScript - TTS Logic:**
        *   Implemented `populateVoiceList()` to get available system voices using `speechSynthesis.getVoices()` and populate the dropdown. This function is also attached to `speechSynthesis.onvoiceschanged`.
        *   Implemented `speak(textToSpeak)` function that creates a `SpeechSynthesisUtterance`, sets the selected voice (from `selectedVoiceURI` chosen via the dropdown), and calls `speechSynthesis.speak()`.
        *   Added checks for browser support for `SpeechSynthesis`.
    *   **JavaScript - SSE Client:**
        *   Implemented a Server-Sent Events (SSE) client connecting to a new `/voice-events` endpoint on the local server.
        *   The `onmessage` handler for SSE expects JSON data like `{ "displayText": "...", "speechText": "..." }`. It calls `addMessage()` to show `displayText` and `speak()` to voice `speechText`.
        *   Basic error handling for SSE connection was included.

3.  **Server Enhancements for TTS (`restless_coder/src/index.ts`):**
    *   **SSE Client Management:** Added a global array `sseClients` to store active `http.ServerResponse` objects for connected SSE clients.
    *   **SSE Endpoint:** Implemented the `/voice-events` HTTP endpoint. When a client connects:
        *   Appropriate SSE headers (`Content-Type: text/event-stream`, etc.) are set.
        *   An initial connection confirmation event is sent to the client.
        *   The client's `response` object is added to `sseClients`.
        *   A `req.on('close')` handler removes the client from `sseClients` upon disconnection.
    *   **`process_voice_command` Tool Modification:**
        *   **Input Schema:** Added two new optional string parameters: `response_display_text` and `response_speech_text`.
        *   **Tool Logic:**
            *   A new operational mode was added: If `response_speech_text` is provided in the arguments, the tool constructs a JSON payload containing `displayText` (defaults to `response_speech_text` if `response_display_text` is missing) and `speechText`.
            *   This payload is then sent as an SSE message (`data: ${payload}\n\n`) to all currently connected clients in the `sseClients` array.
            *   The tool then returns a simple success message (e.g., "Response sent to UI via SSE.") to Cline.
            *   The existing "listen" and "process audio" modes of the tool remain functional and are prioritized after the new "send response" mode check.

4.  **Voice Interaction Protocol Update (`restless_coder/.clinerules/voice_interaction_protocol.md`):**
    *   Updated Cline's responsibilities to include formulating both a concise speech response (max 2-3 sentences) and a potentially more verbose display text.
    *   Modified the interaction flow: after Cline executes a command, it now calls `process_voice_command` (with `response_display_text` and `response_speech_text`) to send its response to the UI, *before* re-entering listen mode.
    *   Updated the custom instruction set for Cline to reflect these new response formulation and delivery steps.
    *   Updated prerequisites to include the new server/UI capabilities (SSE, TTS, new tool parameters).

5.  **Testing the Enhanced Protocol:**
    *   After the user rebuilt and restarted the `restless_coder` server, the updated voice protocol was initiated.
    *   Successfully tested:
        *   Basic "can you hear me" interaction with spoken response from Cline.
        *   A simple calculation ("whats 2 + 3") with spoken result.
        *   Reciting text ("Homer's Odyssey") with spoken recitation.
        *   A multi-turn command (file creation, asking for filename) where Cline's questions and confirmations were spoken.
    *   The session concluded with the user verbally ending the protocol.

**Current Status:**
*   The voice interaction system now supports TTS responses from Cline, delivered to the UI via SSE.
*   The UI allows voice selection for TTS.
*   The `process_voice_command` tool and the voice interaction protocol documentation have been updated to reflect these new capabilities.
*   The system has been successfully tested with these enhancements.

## 2025-06-01 (Part 6): Code Cleanup, Refactoring, and UI Bug Fixes

**Objective:** Improve code maintainability, organization, and resolve UI functionality issues that arose after initial refactoring.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Server-Side Refactoring (`restless_coder/src/index.ts`):**
    *   Removed unused/placeholder interface definitions (`SpeechRecognitionService`, etc.).
    *   Modularized HTTP route handling: Logic for `/`, `/submit-transcribed-text`, and `/voice-events` was moved from `index.ts` into a new dedicated file: `restless_coder/src/httpHandlers.ts`.
    *   The main `CallToolRequestSchema` handler in `index.ts` was refactored to delegate its core logic (Send Response, Process Audio, Listen modes) to smaller, internal helper functions (`handleSendCommandResponseMode`, `handleProcessAudioMode`, `handleListenMode`, `processTranscribedTextAndRespond`) for improved clarity and structure.
    *   Standardized logging prefixes across `index.ts` and `httpHandlers.ts` (e.g., `[HTTP Handler]`, `[Tool Process]`, `[Lifecycle]`, `[Startup]`) for better log readability.
    *   Reviewed and confirmed the existing `gracefulShutdown` logic.

2.  **Client-Side UI Refactoring (`restless_coder/ui/`):**
    *   The monolithic JavaScript block in `restless_coder/ui/index.html` was broken down into separate ES modules:
        *   `uiUtils.js`: Contains shared DOM element accessors (e.g., `voiceButton`, `messagesDiv`) and utility functions like `addMessage`. DOM elements are now initialized via `initializeUiElements()` called on `DOMContentLoaded`.
        *   `speechRecognition.js`: Encapsulates all Web Speech API (STT) related setup, event handlers, and transcription submission logic.
        *   `textToSpeech.js`: Encapsulates all Web Speech Synthesis API (TTS) related setup, voice population, and speaking logic.
        *   `sseClient.js`: Handles the Server-Sent Events client connection and message processing for receiving responses from the server.
    *   `restless_coder/ui/index.html` was updated to use `<script type="module">` to import and initialize these new JavaScript modules.

3.  **Bug Fixing - UI Functionality:**
    *   **Initial Issue:** UI buttons and dropdowns were non-functional after initial JS modularization.
    *   **Diagnosis 1:** Hypothesized that DOM elements were being accessed by modules before the DOM was fully loaded.
    *   **Fix 1 Attempted:** Modified `uiUtils.js` to populate its exported DOM element variables within an `initializeUiElements()` function, and updated `index.html` to call this function first on `DOMContentLoaded`. This aimed to ensure elements were available when other modules' `initialize...` functions ran.
    *   **Diagnosis 2 (Server Connection Failure):** After Fix 1, the server failed to start, preventing UI testing.
    *   **Fix 2 (Server Startup):** Identified a `ReferenceError` in `httpHandlers.ts` caused by accessing `UI_FILE_PATH` (imported from `index.ts`) before it was initialized (Temporal Dead Zone). Resolved this by making `UI_BASE_DIR` in `httpHandlers.ts` lazy-initialized via a `getUiBaseDir()` function.
    *   **Diagnosis 3 (UI Still Not Working - Module Loading):** After Fix 2, the UI was still non-functional. Realized the HTTP server in `index.ts` was not configured to serve `.js` files from the `ui/` directory with the correct MIME type (`application/javascript`), leading to module loading failures.
    *   **Fix 3 (Static File Serving):**
        *   Added a `handleStaticFile` function to `httpHandlers.ts` to serve files from the `ui/` directory, setting `Content-Type: application/javascript` for `.js` files.
        *   Updated the HTTP server routing logic in `index.ts` to use `handleStaticFile` for requests ending in `.js` (and `.css`).

4.  **Testing and Verification:**
    *   After implementing Fix 3 and rebuilding, the server started successfully.
    *   The UI (`http://localhost:6543`) became functional: the "Start Listening" button and voice selection dropdown worked as expected.
    *   Successfully tested the end-to-end voice interaction protocol:
        *   Cline initiated "listen" mode.
        *   User spoke "do you hear me" into the UI.
        *   Transcribed text was sent to the server and then to Cline.
        *   Cline responded "Yes, I hear you loud and clear!", which was displayed and spoken in the UI.
        *   Cline re-entered listen mode.
        *   User spoke "fantastic thanks so much".
        *   Cline responded "You're welcome!", which was displayed and spoken in the UI.
        *   Cline re-entered listen mode.

5.  **Other Files:**
    *   `restless_coder/voice-client-host/`: Confirmed to be empty/non-existent, requiring no action.
    *   `restless_coder/kill_port_6543.ps1`: Reviewed and retained as a useful utility.
    *   `README.md`: Reviewed and determined no updates were necessary for these internal refactoring changes.

**Current Status:**
*   The codebase has been significantly refactored for better organization and maintainability.
*   Critical UI bugs related to JavaScript module loading and DOM initialization have been resolved.
*   The voice interaction protocol is confirmed to be working correctly after the changes.
*   The project is in a stable state, ready for further feature development (e.g., responsiveness improvements, Codespaces support).

## 2025-06-01 (Part 7): TypeScript Error Resolution and Voice Protocol Test

**Objective:** Resolve persistent TypeScript errors in `src/index.ts` and conduct a test of the voice interaction protocol.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **TypeScript Error Investigation (`src/index.ts`):**
    *   Iteratively diagnosed a "Declaration or statement expected" error.
    *   Initial attempts involved changing `catch (error: any)` to `catch (error: unknown)` and refactoring the `handleListenMode` function's promise logic.
    *   The error was ultimately resolved by reordering the helper function definitions (`handleSendCommandResponseMode`, `handleProcessAudioMode`, `handleListenMode`, `processTranscribedTextAndRespond`) to appear *before* the main `server.setRequestHandler(CallToolRequestSchema, ...)` block. This suggests a parsing or hoisting-related issue with the previous structure.

2.  **Project Build:**
    *   Successfully compiled the project using `npm run build`, confirming no TypeScript errors remained.

3.  **Voice Interaction Protocol Test:**
    *   Initiated the voice protocol.
    *   Cline entered "listen" mode using the `process_voice_command` tool.
    *   User spoke "can you hear me". The tool returned this text to Cline.
    *   Cline responded "Yes, I hear you loud and clear!". This response was sent to the UI using `process_voice_command` in "send response" mode.
    *   Cline re-entered "listen" mode.
    *   User spoke "end the protocol". The tool returned this text to Cline.
    *   Cline responded "Okay, I am ending the voice interaction protocol.". This response was sent to the UI.
    *   The protocol was successfully terminated.

**Current Status:**
*   All identified TypeScript errors in `src/index.ts` have been resolved.
*   The project builds successfully.
*   The voice interaction protocol, including listening for commands and sending responses to the UI, is functional.

## 2025-06-02: MCP Connection Troubleshooting and Protocol Test

**Objective:** Resolve persistent "Not connected" errors when Cline attempted to use the `restless_coder` MCP server, and subsequently test the voice interaction protocol.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Initial Diagnosis:**
    *   Cline reported "Not connected" when trying to use `process_voice_command` from the `restless_coder` server.
    *   Verified the server process started successfully (logged `[MCP Server] Restless Coder MCP server running on stdio`).
    *   Checked `cline_mcp_settings.json` and confirmed the path to `build/index.js` for `restless_coder` was correct.

2.  **MCP Inspector Usage:**
    *   Ran the `restless_coder` server via `npm run inspector`.
    *   When Cline attempted to connect (either via `process_voice_command` or `mcp_list_tools`), the MCP Inspector showed no incoming connection attempts or activity related to `restless_coder`.

3.  **Comparative Test:**
    *   Successfully used another configured MCP server (Brave Search) via Cline, indicating Cline's general MCP client functionality was working. This pointed to an issue specific to how Cline was handling the `restless_coder` configuration.

4.  **Configuration Refresh:**
    *   Hypothesized that Cline might have a stale or corrupted internal representation of the `restless_coder` server configuration.
    *   Guided the user to effectively "reinstall" the server configuration in `cline_mcp_settings.json`:
        *   The user deleted the `restless_coder` entry from the JSON file (simulating removal via a UI).
        *   The `restless_coder` entry was then programmatically added back to `cline_mcp_settings.json`.
        *   VS Code was restarted to ensure Cline re-read its settings.

5.  **Successful Connection and Protocol Test:**
    *   After the configuration refresh and VS Code restart, with the `restless_coder` server running via `npm run inspector`:
        *   Cline successfully connected to the `restless_coder` server.
        *   The voice interaction protocol was initiated.
        *   Cline entered "listen" mode.
        *   User provided the voice command "hi testing testing Can You Hear Me" via the web UI (`http://localhost:6543`).
        *   The command was transcribed, sent to the server, and relayed to Cline.
        *   Cline responded "Yes, I hear you loud and clear!", which was successfully sent to the UI via SSE for display and speech.
        *   Cline re-entered "listen" mode.
        *   User provided the voice command "play the protocol for now" (interpreted as "end the protocol").
        *   The command was processed, and Cline responded "Okay, I will end the voice interaction protocol for now.", which was sent to the UI.
        *   The voice protocol was then ended.

**Current Status:**
*   The "Not connected" issue with the `restless_coder` MCP server has been resolved. The root cause appeared to be related to Cline's internal handling of the server configuration, which was fixed by removing and re-adding the configuration.
*   The full voice interaction protocol, including Cline listening, receiving commands from the UI, processing them, and sending spoken/displayed responses back to the UI, is confirmed to be functional.
*   The MCP Inspector was a key tool in diagnosing that Cline was not even attempting to launch the server process initially.

## 2025-06-02 (Part 2): UI Enhancements for Voice Client

**Objective:** Improve the user interface (`ui/index.html`) for the voice client, focusing on message display order, visual aesthetics, and text animation.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Reverse Chronological Order & Scrolling:**
    *   Modified `ui/uiUtils.js` (`addMessage` function) to prepend new message slides to the top of the container, instead of appending.
    *   Initially, `scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'start' })` was used in `ui/index.html` to scroll to new messages. This was later removed as prepending achieved the desired effect.
    *   Addressed an issue where the page scrolled to the bottom on new message receipt by implementing scroll position preservation in `ui/uiUtils.js` (capturing `scrollTop` and `scrollHeight` before prepending, then adjusting `scrollTop` after).
    *   Finally, to ensure the newest message is always at the very top of the viewport, the scroll preservation was replaced with a direct `fullpageSlidesDiv.scrollTop = 0;` in `ui/uiUtils.js` after a new message is added.

2.  **Visual Styling (Inspired by animejs.com):**
    *   Updated CSS in `ui/index.html`:
        *   Changed font to 'Inter' and a system font stack.
        *   Implemented a darker background theme (`#1a1a1a`) with refined accent colors for user/assistant messages (`#81c784`, `#64b5f6`).
        *   Restyled the header, title, and controls for a cleaner, more modern look.
        *   Message slide containers (`.slide`) were initially styled as cards, then later made "invisible" (transparent background, no border/shadow) with height determined by content. Padding was adjusted.
    *   Removed `scroll-snap-type` and adjusted `min-height` on `.slide` elements to allow multiple messages to be visible in the viewport.

3.  **Character-by-Character Fade-In Animation:**
    *   Modified `ui/uiUtils.js` (`addMessage` function) to wrap each character of the incoming text in a `<span>` element with `style="opacity: 0;"`.
    *   Updated the `IntersectionObserver` logic in `ui/index.html` to target these character `<span>`s.
    *   Used `anime.js` with `timeline` and `stagger` to make characters fade in sequentially.
        *   Initial animation parameters: `duration: 50`, `delay: anime.stagger(50)`.
        *   Adjusted for a "waterfall" effect: `duration: 250`, `delay: anime.stagger(25)`.
    *   Removed a call to `adjustFontSizeToFit` in `ui/uiUtils.js` as it was resetting `innerHTML` and breaking the character `<span>` structure needed for animation.

4.  **Sequential Animation for Rapid Messages:**
    *   Implemented an animation queue in `ui/index.html` to handle messages arriving in rapid succession.
    *   Introduced `animationQueue` array and `isAnimating` flag.
    *   Created `processAnimationQueue()` function to manage sequential animation of messages. Each animation's `complete` callback triggers the next in the queue.
    *   Both new SSE messages and slides scrolled into view via `IntersectionObserver` are added to this queue.

**Current Status:**
*   The voice client UI now displays messages in reverse chronological order, with the newest message at the top and the view scrolled to the top.
*   Visuals are updated with a modern dark theme.
*   Message containers are invisible, sized by content, and allow multiple messages to be viewed.
*   Messages fade in character-by-character with a "waterfall" effect.
*   An animation queue ensures messages animate sequentially, even if received rapidly.
*   The UI is significantly more polished and user-friendly.

## 2025-06-02 (Part 3): Further UI Refinements (Font, Sizing, Animation)

**Objective:** Implement additional user-requested refinements to the voice client UI, focusing on font, dynamic text sizing, message prefaces, and animation speed controls.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Font Change and Dynamic Sizing:**
    *   Modified `ui/index.html` to import and use the "Poppins" font via Google Fonts.
    *   Updated the CSS for `.slide-content` to use `font-size: clamp(16px, 2.0vw, 24px);`, making the font size responsive to window width while maintaining readability within a defined range (initially `clamp(14px, 1.6vw, 20px)`, then increased).

2.  **User Message Preface Removal:**
    *   Modified `ui/speechRecognition.js` in the `handleTranscription` function.
    *   Changed `addMessage(\`You said: "${text}"\`, 'user-message');` to `addMessage(text, 'user-message');` to remove both the "You said: " preface and the surrounding quotation marks from the display of user's transcribed speech. Assistant messages retain their prefaces.

3.  **Animation Speed Adjustments:**
    *   Modified the JavaScript animation logic in `ui/index.html` within the `processAnimationQueue` function.
    *   The `baseIndividualCharAnimDurationMs` (duration for a single character to fade in) was increased from 100ms to 200ms to make the individual character fade-in appear slower.
    *   The logic for calculating `staggerDelay` and `charAnimDuration` was updated to meet two primary conditions:
        1.  The total animation for a message aims to complete within approximately 750 milliseconds.
        2.  The animation speed should not drop below a minimum of 20 characters per second. If the 750ms target would result in a speed below 20cps, the animation parameters are adjusted to maintain 20cps, potentially exceeding the 750ms total duration for very long messages.
    *   For single-character messages, `charAnimDuration` is specially calculated to try and meet the 20cps speed (i.e., animate in 50ms or less if the base duration was longer).
    *   A practical minimum stagger delay (e.g., 5ms) is maintained.

**Current Status:**
*   The UI uses the "Poppins" font with dynamic sizing.
*   User messages are displayed without any preface or quotes.
*   The character-by-character animation has a slower individual character fade-in and dynamically adjusts its overall speed based on message length, a target total duration, and a minimum characters-per-second rate.
*   The voice interaction protocol was briefly tested with these UI changes.

## 2025-06-02 (Part 4): Mobile Client Connectivity Fix

**Objective:** Resolve an issue where the voice client UI (`ui/index.html`), when accessed from a mobile device on the local network, could receive messages from the server but could not submit transcribed text back to the server.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Problem Diagnosis:**
    *   User reported that submitting text from a mobile device resulted in a "network error: could not submit text. Is the server running?" message, even though the server was running and accessible (SSE messages were being received by the mobile client).
    *   Hypothesized that the server might only be listening on `localhost` (127.0.0.1), or the client might be hardcoding `localhost` in its request URL.

2.  **Server-Side Modification (`src/index.ts`):**
    *   Reviewed `src/index.ts` and found that the HTTP server's `listen` call did not specify a hostname, defaulting to `localhost`.
    *   Modified the `httpServer.listen(port, ...)` call within the `startHttpServer` function to `httpServer.listen(port, '0.0.0.0', ...)`. This makes the server listen on all available network interfaces, allowing connections from other devices on the local network.
    *   Updated the console log message to reflect the change: `[HTTP Server] UI available at http://0.0.0.0:${port} (accessible on your local network)`.
    *   Rebuilt the project using `npm run build` to apply these changes.

3.  **Client-Side Modification (`ui/speechRecognition.js`):**
    *   Reviewed `ui/speechRecognition.js` and found that the `fetch` request to `/submit-transcribed-text` was hardcoded to `http://localhost:6543/submit-transcribed-text`.
    *   Changed the URL in the `fetch` call to a relative path: `'/submit-transcribed-text'`. This ensures the client sends the request to the same host and port from which the `index.html` page was served.

4.  **Testing and Verification:**
    *   After restarting the server and clearing the mobile browser cache:
        *   The voice interaction protocol was initiated.
        *   The user successfully submitted a voice command ("can you hear me now") from the mobile device.
        *   Cline received the command and responded, confirming the fix.

**Current Status:**
*   The mobile client connectivity issue is resolved. The voice client UI can now successfully submit transcribed text to the server when accessed from a mobile device on the local network.
*   The server listens on `0.0.0.0`, and the client uses a relative path for API requests.
*   The voice interaction protocol remains fully functional with these fixes.

## 2025-06-02 (Part 5): Add "Processing..." Indicator to UI

**Objective:** Enhance the voice client UI to display a "Processing..." message after a user's command is sent and remove it when the assistant's response is received.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Shared State for Processing Message (`ui/uiUtils.js`):**
    *   Added an exported variable `currentProcessingSlide` initialized to `null`. This will hold a reference to the DOM element of the "Processing..." message.
    *   Modified the `addMessage` function to recognize a `className` containing `processing-indicator`. If found, it adds `system-message` and `processing-indicator` classes to the slide.

2.  **Displaying "Processing..." Message (`ui/speechRecognition.js`):**
    *   Imported `currentProcessingSlide` (aliased as `processingSlideRef`) from `ui/uiUtils.js`.
    *   In the `handleTranscription` function, after the user's message is added to the UI:
        *   Any existing `processingSlideRef.current` is defensively removed from the DOM.
        *   A new message "Processing..." is added using `addMessage("Processing...", "system-message processing-indicator")`.
        *   The returned DOM element from `addMessage` is stored in `processingSlideRef.current`.

3.  **Removing "Processing..." Message (`ui/sseClient.js`):**
    *   Imported `currentProcessingSlide` (aliased as `processingSlideRef`) from `ui/uiUtils.js`.
    *   In the `evtSource.onmessage` handler (which processes incoming SSE messages from the server):
        *   Before adding the assistant's actual response message to the UI, it checks if `processingSlideRef.current` exists and is part of the DOM.
        *   If it exists, `processingSlideRef.current.remove()` is called to remove the "Processing..." message.
        *   `processingSlideRef.current` is then set back to `null`.

**Current Status:**
*   The UI now displays a "Processing..." message immediately after the user's transcribed command is shown.
*   This "Processing..." message is removed from the UI just before the assistant's response is displayed.
*   This provides better visual feedback to the user about the state of their command.
*   Client-side changes only; no server rebuild required. User needs to clear browser cache and reload the UI page.

## 2025-06-02 (Part 6): UI Bug Fixing ("Malformed Message" and "Processing..." Indicator)

**Objective:** Resolve UI bugs reported after implementing the "Processing..." indicator, specifically a "received malformed message from server" error and issues with the "Processing..." message display.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Diagnosis of "Malformed Message" and "Processing..." Indicator Issues:**
    *   User reported seeing "received malformed message from server" upon opening the UI.
    *   User also reported no indication of voice input going through (potentially related to the "Processing..." message).
    *   The "malformed message" error in `ui/sseClient.js` was generic. The initial SSE connection message from the server (`{"type":"connection_established",...}`) was valid JSON but did not contain `displayText` or `speechText`, which the client was implicitly expecting for all messages.
    *   A key issue was identified in `ui/uiUtils.js`: `currentProcessingSlide` was exported as `null`, but `ui/speechRecognition.js` and `ui/sseClient.js` were attempting to use it as an object with a `.current` property (e.g., `processingSlideRef.current`). This would cause a runtime error when trying to set or access `.current` on `null`.

2.  **Fixing `currentProcessingSlide` Handling:**
    *   Modified `ui/uiUtils.js`: Changed the declaration of `currentProcessingSlide` from `export let currentProcessingSlide = null;` to `export let currentProcessingSlide = { current: null };`. This aligns its structure with how it was being used in other modules.

3.  **Refining SSE Message Handling (`ui/sseClient.js`):**
    *   Updated the `evtSource.onmessage` handler:
        *   It now first attempts to `JSON.parse(event.data)`. If this fails, it logs an error and returns, preventing the "malformed message" from being displayed in the UI for actual JSON parsing errors.
        *   It explicitly checks if `data.type === "connection_established"`. If so, it logs a confirmation to the console and returns, preventing this initial, valid server message from being treated as a displayable chat message or an error.
        *   The logic to remove `processingSlideRef.current` was confirmed to be correctly placed after these initial checks and before processing a displayable assistant message.
        *   Added a console warning if an SSE message is received that is valid JSON but has no `displayText`, `speechText`, and isn't the `connection_established` type.

**Current Status:**
*   The `currentProcessingSlide` variable in `ui/uiUtils.js` is now correctly structured as an object, resolving potential runtime errors in `ui/speechRecognition.js` and `ui/sseClient.js` when accessing its `.current` property. This should fix the "Processing..." indicator logic.
*   The SSE client in `ui/sseClient.js` now handles the initial server connection message gracefully, preventing the "received malformed message from server" error from appearing in the UI for that specific event.
*   These changes are client-side only and require a browser cache clear and page reload to take effect.

## 2025-06-02 (Part 7): Refine UI Feedback for Listening and Submission States

**Objective:** Further improve the voice client UI by managing the "Listening..." message display and removing the explicit "Server: text submitted successfully" confirmation, based on user feedback.

**Steps Taken:**

1.  **Add `currentListeningSlide` to `ui/uiUtils.js`:**
    *   Added `export let currentListeningSlide = { current: null };` to share the reference to the "Listening..." message slide.

2.  **Manage "Listening..." Message in `ui/speechRecognition.js`:**
    *   Imported `currentListeningSlide` (as `listeningSlideRef`).
    *   In `recognition.onstart`:
        *   Before adding a new "Listening..." message, any existing one is removed.
        *   The new "Listening..." message slide is created and its reference stored in `listeningSlideRef.current`.
    *   In `handleTranscription`:
        *   After the `fetch` call to `/submit-transcribed-text` completes (whether successful or not), if `listeningSlideRef.current` exists, it is removed from the DOM and the reference is cleared. This ensures the "Listening..." message disappears once transcription is submitted.

3.  **Remove Server Submission Confirmation Message in `ui/speechRecognition.js`:**
    *   In `handleTranscription`, within the `if (response.ok)` block after a successful `fetch`, the line `addMessage(\`Server: \${result.message}\`, 'assistant-message');` was removed. The `response.json()` is still consumed, but its content (typically "Text submitted successfully.") is no longer displayed in the UI.

**Current Status:**
*   The UI now displays a "Listening..." message when speech recognition starts.
*   This "Listening..." message is removed from the UI as soon as the transcribed text is sent to the server.
*   The explicit "Server: text submitted successfully" message is no longer shown, streamlining the UI feedback loop. The appearance of the "Processing..." message now serves as the primary indicator that the submission was sent.
*   These changes are client-side only.

## 2025-06-02 (Part 8): Troubleshoot Mobile TTS Voice Selection

**Objective:** Resolve an issue where the selected voice in the UI's dropdown menu was not being used for TTS output on mobile devices, even though it worked on desktop.

**Initial State:** User reported that the voice selection menu worked fine (populated and selection used) prior to the current session's changes. The initial problem for this session was described as "assistant voice menu choice doesn't appear to be properly work on my mobile device."

**Steps Taken & Findings:**

1.  **Enhanced Logging (`ui/textToSpeech.js`):**
    *   Added detailed console logging to `populateVoiceList`, `speak`, and `initializeTextToSpeech` to trace voice loading, selection, and usage.
    *   Modified `populateVoiceList` to attempt to preserve the existing `voiceSelect.value` if the selected voice URI was still valid after `onvoiceschanged` fired.

2.  **Speech Engine Priming (`ui/speechRecognition.js`):**
    *   As mobile console logs were unavailable, implemented a common workaround: added a "priming" call (`speechSynthesis.speak()` with a silent, non-empty utterance ` ' ' `) triggered by the first click of the "Record Message" button.
    *   **Observation:** After this, the user reported the voice menu *was* properly populated on mobile, and audio was heard, but it was a default voice, not the selected one.

3.  **Temporary Removal of Priming:**
    *   To isolate effects, the priming call was temporarily commented out.
    *   **Observation:** This resulted in *no audio output* on both mobile and desktop, suggesting that a user-gesture-initiated `speechSynthesis.speak()` call is crucial for enabling TTS output for the session. Priming was then reinstated.

4.  **Refined `speak()` Logic (`ui/textToSpeech.js`):**
    *   Modified the `speak` function to call `speechSynthesis.getVoices()` directly at the time of speaking. This ensures it uses the absolute freshest list of voice objects from the browser when trying to find the voice matching `selectedVoiceURI`.

5.  **Refined `populateVoiceList()` Logic (`ui/textToSpeech.js`):**
    *   Further refined `populateVoiceList` to make the module-level `selectedVoiceURI` the primary source of truth. The function now tries to set the dropdown's visual selection (`voiceSelect.value`) to match `selectedVoiceURI`. If `selectedVoiceURI` is null or becomes invalid (e.g., after `onvoiceschanged`), then `populateVoiceList` picks a new default voice and updates both `voiceSelect.value` and the module-level `selectedVoiceURI`.

**Final Test Results:**
*   **Desktop:** TTS uses the voice selected in the dropdown menu correctly.
*   **Mobile:**
    *   The voice selection dropdown populates with options.
    *   Audio output is functional (the priming step appears necessary for this).
    *   However, the spoken voice is a default system voice, *not* the voice selected by the user in the dropdown.

**Current Status & Conclusion:**
*   The issue of the selected voice not being used on mobile persists, despite working on desktop.
*   The problem is highly specific to the mobile browser's implementation or restrictions regarding the Web Speech API (`utterance.voice` assignment).
*   Common JavaScript workarounds (priming, ensuring fresh voice lists, robust selection logic) have been attempted. The current client-side code appears logically sound for voice selection, as evidenced by correct behavior on desktop.
*   Further resolution for mobile would likely require direct debugging on the target mobile device (e.g., with remote developer tools) to inspect console logs and API behavior, or more advanced, browser-specific handling that is beyond general best practices.
*   The system is functional for voice selection on desktop, and provides audible (though default-voiced) TTS feedback on mobile.
